# Treb

Authors: R. Seguel, M. Bataille, P. Cuello and J.P. Soto
This is a project to participate in a competition organized by our local university in Concepción, Chili.
Our goal is to pursue our study of this trebuchet in order to participate in the French Olimpiads of Physics.


## Structure

You can find a LaTeX folder wich contains every LaTeX associated file (including .pdf files). This folder is divided into 2 categories (maybe a
third one is coming): main (written in french and the one that is constantly beeing actualized) and esp (written in spanish).

You can also find a Simulation folder wich contains every python file that runs the simulation of the trebuchet (and the outputs as .mp4 and .png) and eventually ipython files (aka jupyter) wich explain the code behind the simulation.

In other words:

.
├── LaTeX (every LaTeX associated file, including .pdf)
│   ├── esp (pdf file written in spanish)
│   └── main (... in french, constantly actualized)
├── main.pdf (written in french)
└── Simulation (every python file behind the simulation, output (as .mp4 and .png) )
